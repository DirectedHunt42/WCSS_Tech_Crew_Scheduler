    1. As a teacher, I want to see a calendar to select dates, "What do you need" list (microphone, projector, speaker etc)[what the teacher needs], So that the teacher can select the date that they want tech services as well as telling tech crew what equipment they need.
    2. As a member, I want a calendar to see events, the option to opt in to an event as well as helpful information, So that I may sign up for events.
    3. As an admin, I want see the same calendar as the internal page, with each day booked and able to see the teacher name and the details of the service, as well as the option to post it to the members page as well as selecting members for each event the opted in, So that I can asses the needs and delegate appropriately.

    1. As a student, I want to see a fully functional program that has multiple graphical user interfaces, So that there are no errors and I can get a good mark.

    1. As a member/admin/user i want the system to have a fully working scheduler as well as resources that will help new members. The event creation systems for admins must be easy to use and allow for the addition of events in ~1 min. For the app on the internal page, the system needs to be easy to use so that any teacher/ faculty member that needs A/V tech for an event may book it with extreme ease. With all the features, more events at school will have proper tech setup for them so that the events will run efficiently.
