1. As a teacher, I want to see a calendar to select dates, "What do you need" list (microphone, projector, speaker etc)[what the teacher needs], So that the teacher can select the date that they want tech services as well as telling tech crew what equipment they need.
2. As a member, I want a calendar to see events, the option to opt in to an event as well as helpful information, So that i may sign up for events.
3. As an admin, I same calendar as Internal page, each day booked see teacher name and the details of the service, as well as the option to post it to the members page as well as selecting members for each event that opt in, So that i can asses the needs and delegate appropriately.
