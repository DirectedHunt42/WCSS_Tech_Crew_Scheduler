Description 
    The WCSS Tech Crew Scheduler is a comprehensive scheduling application designed to streamline the management of technical crews within the WCSS Tech Crew. It addresses the coordinating of volunteers for various events and projects by providing a centralized platform for scheduling, resource allocation, and conflict resolution. The system allows administrators to input event details, including dates, times, required crew members, and specific equipment needs. Crew members can access the system to view their assigned tasks, update their availability, and communicate with administrators. The system's user-friendly interface and intuitive design ensure ease of use for both administrators and crew members, regardless of their technical expertise.
